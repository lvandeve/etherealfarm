    Nuts crops unlock at tree level 45, the first one is Almond. You can have max 1 nut crop in the main field, but it can be upgraded and replaced with better types. Nuts crops benefit from flowers, but only in a limited form independent of flower upgrades or bees, nuts crops are not affected by the same boosts as berries or mushrooms, they have their own more limited boosts. Watercress can copy from nuts, but only at half effectiveness and without fruit bonus. Nuts are negatively affected by winter if not next to tree, just like most crops.
    <br><br>
    Buy squirrel upgrades in the squirrel tab. Squirrel upgrades are laid out in a tech tree. Each next squirrel upgrade costs exponentially more than the previous one, no matter what order you do them in. Get higher tree levels and nut crops to get enough nuts for the next one.
    <br><br>
    You can respec the squirrel upgrades if you regret a decision, using a respec token. You get a few for free, more can be gotten for amber in the amber tab.
    <br><br>
    After you respec squirrel upgrades at least once, the "buy all to here" option unlocks for upgrades you have seen before: click the upgrade icon of any squirrel upgrade further down in the tree, then use this button to automatically buy this upgrade and all squirrel upgrades required to reach this one (including all of gated stages), if you can afford it. This avoid having to click every individual upgrade again after respec.
    <br><br>
    Planting and upgrading nuts crops cost spores instead of seeds. They work with automaton just like most other crops. If the automaton is spending too much spores on nuts upgrades and you want the tree to level up instead, decrease the allowed % setting for nuts upgrades in the automaton settings.

registerHelpDialog(44, 'Tower defense', 'You started the tower defense challenge!',
    `
    Tower defense plays very different from the regular game, this help summarizes it all.
    <br><br>
    During tower defense, waves of pests will spawn from the burrow at the top left of the field, and want to move to the tree. As soon as any pest reaches the tree, it's game over and the challenge must be ended. Two types crops can attack pests: mushrooms and brassica. All other crops are support crops required to make the mushroom and brassica work.
    <br><br>
    Crop types:<br>
    • mushroom: Requires a neighboring berry, and boosted by flower and nettles as usual. Can attack at range.<br>
    • brassica: Requires neighboring mushroom (diagonal works too) to copy spores from. Can attack directly adjecent pests only, but multiple at the same time.<br>
    • berry: required to make mushrooms work. Produces seeds for the mushroom. Does not produce seeds for the player (seeds are gained from exterminated pests instead)<br>
    • flower: boost neighboring mushrooms and berries as usual<br>
    • bee: boosts neighboring flowers as usual<br>
    • nettle: boosts neighboring mushrooms, but also increases seed consumption, unlike normally<br>
    • statues: different types exist, affects orthogonally or diagonally adjecent mushrooms with improved damage and special effects, see list further in this help for the types and their effects<br>
    <br><br>
    You must exterminate waves of pests to progress to the next level. Pests drop spores and seeds, spores to level up the tree to the next level, seeds to allow building better towers. All crops block the path of pests, so you can build a maze to extend the distance they have to walk to reach the tree. However, it's impossible to close the maze (there must always be some path), and it's impossible to delete crops (but you can change their type).
    <br><br>
    Build a maze first, and press the 'GO' button in the top right when ready to spawn the first wave. If you're much stronger than the first wave, it'll skip ahead to later waves. Before starting the first wave, deleting crops is still possible so you can fix mistakes in the shape of the maze until then.
    <br><br>
    Tips:<br>
    • Ensure a mushroom is surrounced by a flower with bee, a berry with flower with bee, a nettle, and possibly statues and brassica. Missing any of these components makes the mushroom much weaker than is possible.<br>
    • Build a long maze from crops, so that the pests spend a long time to reach it and can be attacked for longer, but also have enough densely packed groups of crops to have mushrooms with all the support crops and multiple statues.<br>
    • Groups of multiple pests are best defeated with splash damage, while a single pest with a lot of health is better dealt with by a sniper tower or towers with many spore statue boosts.<br>
    <br><br>
    Pest types:<br>
    • ant: standard health, standard speed.<br>
    • fire ant: more health, standard speed, resistant to snail statues.<br>
    • beetle: much more health, moves more slowly.<br>
    • tick: comes in a group within a single cell, splash damage is more effective.<br>
    • roach: less health, but moves fast.<br>
    • termite: more health, moves slower, resistant to splash damage and snail statues<br>
    • flea: comes in a group within a single cell (splash damage is more effective), and moves fast<br>
    • aphid: comes in a group within a single cell (splash damage is more effective), and has more health but is slower<br>
    • locust: moves fast<br>
    <br><br>
    Statue effects:<br>
    • spore statue: makes tower stronger. Can be stacked. If two or more statues active, makes the tower focused (extra damage) when there is a small amount of pests on screen.<br>
    • splash statue: makes tower do splash damage (both within single-cell group pests, and to neighboring pests) but do less single-cell damage.<br>
    • range statue: makes tower reach one cell further. Can be stacked.<br>
    • sniper statue: makes tower stronger and reach whole map, but much slower.<br>
    • snail statue: makes tower cause pests to move slower for a fixed amount of steps. Can be stacked.<br>
    • seed statue: makes tower cause pests to drop more resources. Can be stacked.<br>
    <br><br>
    Shortcuts:<br>
    • w: spawn next wave. Same as the 'GO' button. Also required to start the first wave.<br>
    • u: upgrade tower under mouse cursor.<br>
    • d: downgrade tower under mouse cursor (gives refund), if waves not started yet deletes as usual (in regular game, and before waves started, 'd' deletes, 'shift+d' downgrades).<br>
    • shift+p: overplant with picked (with 'p') crop type (same shortcut as in regular game, but useful here to quickly change crop/tower types).<br>
    • ctrl+click a statue: change into next type of statue.<br>
    • ctrl+shift+click a statue: change into previous type of statue.<br>
    • most other shortcuts of the regular game (like p to plant) work too, the above just lists altered or relevant shortcuts.<br>

    Auto-transcend allows an auto-action to be programmed to transcend, starting a next run.

    <br><br>
    Season-based auto actions allow to override the effect for chosen seasons.
